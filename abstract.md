# How your hobby can help advance your profession




## noise
Do you have a hobby? Why not? Not enough time, too many other things going on, and not really interested in anything but what you're working on? These are all very common reasons for not having a "hobby". Well, I can't help you decide whether or not to have a "hobby," but we can explore how having a hobby can not only improve your outlook on life, but could also help you in your profession. You are probably thinking, "How could underwater basket weaving" help me in my career? There are lots of ways, but you will need to come to my talk! We will explore a number of ways your hobby could help, and, if we are not careful, discover a few more ways that haven't been thought of yet.
